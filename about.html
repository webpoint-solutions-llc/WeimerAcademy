                <h1>True Education</h1>
                <p>To Prove God Right is a journey to be traveled step by step, and with His guidance, we learn to follow His lead every day. As teachers and students, we support each other along the way. And as we struggle, fail, and learn from mistakes, we come to the conclusion that God must be the center of and reason for everything. This is Weimar Academy’s whole focus.
               </p>
               <div class="about-true-education-grid">
                 <p>A typical day for a student attending Weimar Academy will include exercise, 
                     classes, choir, work, and play. As those days stretch into weeks, community
                      involvement, outdoor activities, and spiritual outreach is included. 
                      In the scheme of time, weeks becom  e months, months become years… and years 
                      eventually add up. The time spent at this school is meant to impact a student’s 
                      life, not only for the years spent here, but for eternity.</p>
                 <p>According to Ellen G. White, true education includes more than just academics
                      and study. An education should benefit one’s whole being and existence. 
                      It should affect not only the life here, but also the life that is to come.
                       By God’s grace, teachers are led to Weimar Academy to be providers of education, 
                       but also to be friends, mentors, and examples as well. 
                       These servants of God work diligently to provide students with lessons 
                       about our Heavenly Father, and concepts that are grounded in His word. 
                       Their goal is to make Christ the center of all and to prove, in everything, 
                       that He is right.</p>

                <p>Having been involved with Weimar Academy for the past six years, 
                    3 of which I have spent enrolled in the Academy, 
                    I have had my fair share of Weimar experiences. I have seen people
                     grow not only physically from a Freshman to a Senior, but I have also 
                     seen the spiritual lives of the students grow because of the environment
                      they have been placed in. Every part of the school day gives students
                       the opportunity to grow closer to Christ and deepen their relationship
                        with Him. From morning worship and classes, to work education and choir,
                         everything we do has been put in place to help us practically 
                         live out our school motto… to “prove God right.”
               </p>
             
              </div>
            <div class="true-education-grid-2-right">
                <p>That is the goal. Every student is given the opportunity to practically
                    learn how to “prove God right.” I am now entering my fourth and final 
                    year here at the Academy and if there is one thing that I have learned, 
                    it is this: don’t put anything off till tomorrow unless you are willing 
                    to lose it forever. Looking back on my time at Weimar, I can see the many
                     opportunities I have missed. The countless optional spiritual activities 
                     and Bible studies that I neglected to attend, the meaningful conversations
                      that were cut short for lack of time, all these things are finally catching 
                      up to me.</p>
                      <p>
                        As a freshman, I never thought the time would come for me to graduate, 
                        yet here I am nearing the end of my journey. This place that I 
                        have come to know and love has so much to offer, but it is up to 
                        the individual to decide what their story will be. If you take advantage
                         of the opportunities that the Academy provides, you won’t be disappointed. 
                         Since I first began here at the school, I can say that without a shadow 
                         of a doubt I am a different person than when I first came. With the help 
                         of teachers and experiences that pushed me out of my comfort zone, I have 
                         truly been able to deepen my relationship with Christ and more importantly, 
                         I have learned to prove Him right.</p>

                    <p>Weimar Academy is a place associated with many things. 
                        You may think that this place is a strict conservative regime, but in actuality, 
                        it is probably not as bad as you think. When I first read the handbook 
                        and moved into the dorm, I prepared myself for the strictest of principles; 
                        however, it did not turn out quite the way I thought it would. 
                        It is really the people that make the place what it is.</p>
                </div>  
                <div class="daily-life-bottom-para">
                    <p>The people here were not a cult of homeschoolers, but actually cool people who 
                        were not as weird as I thought they would be. The students 
                        of Weimar are normal Christian teenagers, who simply have a genuine
                         desire to learn, to love, and to serve God with all their hearts. 
                         Not everyone who comes here will perfectly fit the mold, so do not expect utopia,
                          but realize that if you choose God, He will guide and reassure you in your journey 
                          with Him.</p>
                    <p>Here in the dorm there are some responsibilities that you might not have had at home. 
                        You will not have mommy and daddy there to give you everything 
                        you might want or need. Laundry will be your own responsibility. 
                        No one will be there to prod you on about homework. You will have 
                        to take care of yourself in some respects, but that is a useful thing 
                        to learn when you are still in high school and have the mentorship of 
                        staff and godly friends.</p>

                    There are some great benefits with living right down the hall from your friends. 
                    There is definitely more bonding time with fellow students, which can be a real blessing. 
                    The deans are here to help and guide the students, but if you need help, you will have 
                    to reach out to them, because they might not be as good at mindreading as your parents.
                     Weimar Academy is a great opportunity to learn to know God and develop lifelong friends 
                     if that is your sincere desire.

                        Weimar is not just like home. If you choose to look for them, there will always 
                        be opportunity to complain. The cafeteria food will be different from home-cooked food.
                         Many things that you might feel are a major part of your life are not allowed in Weimar, 
                         including movies, gaming, and other media. But one thing I have learned even more here is 
                         that there is a deeper, more beautiful meaning to life than entertainment. Learning to be a more
                          socially interactive and productive person is one of the greatest blessings God gave me. Ultimately,
                           there are pros and cons with practically everything in life. Is my school perfect? By no means,
                            but it has been a major blessing in my life. Who knows if God has a plan for you that will 
                            lead you here? Pray and ask God if He has a plan for you at Weimar.

                          It is also a great relief to have a break once in a while from Weimar campus,
                           and a privilege that not all students have. I would recommend being a village
                            student for those who live around the area, who think it would be better to
                             stay with their families, and who want to save a considerable amount of money. 
                             You will be able to enjoy the richness of Weimar Academy – the priceless experiences,
                              the friends, and the communion with God – all from the comfort of your own house

                    to us.</p>

                            <p>Every morning before classes, we begin with a time for song and worship. Throughout the school year, 
                                each student shares a worship talk. Normally the worship talks go by classes starting with the seniors 
                                first all the way to the freshmen. There is something special about how each student describes God in 
                                their own personal way, and while it may seem intimidating at first, it is an 
                                opportunity you will not regret. </p>

                                Another time where each student can not only learn more about, but experience, 
                                God, is during week of prayer. Every semester, we bring in a guest to speak about prayer,
                                 full surrender, and practical Christianity. Some of these past speakers have included Anil
                                  Kanda and Gem Castor. Through their messages and the time spent together in prayer,
                                 each academy student is not only able to see a clearer picture of Christ, but also 
                                 have tools to show others to Him as well.</p>

                            <p>If there’s anything that each academy student looks 
                                forward to the most, it would probably be divided between two of Weimar Academy’s
                                 highlights of the year: choir tour and mission 
                                 trip. Both of those events are instrumental in shaping the experiences 
                                 of the student body for the rest of the year. 
                                 It is during these moments when prayer and faith are increased, and lifelong 
                                 memories are made.</p>
              
                             <p> It is only because of God that daily worship talks,
                                  week of prayer, choir tour, and mission trips exist. 
                                  None of the blessings
                               we receive are because of our own works. It is our desire 
                               that Christ be increased in everything we do, and we hope 
                               that is the desire of every prospective student as well.</p>

                                      <p>We are surrounded by music. Whether you’re at your local grocery store or walking through a park, 
                                          chances are you will hear some kind of music. Because of how important music is, it is not 
                                          something to be overlooked in the course of true education. </p>

                                          That is why it is incorporated into our daily school schedule at Weimar Academy. Each student 
                                          is given the opportunity to glorify God through means of song, whether by singing in choir, 
                                          participating in the orchestra, or simply leading out in worship services. While all the students are r
                                          equired to participate in one way or another, one advantage of the music program is that you do not need 
                                          to be an exceptional singer or be the best at a particular instrument. No matter your skill level, you will 
                                          have the chance to grow musically and be a part of worshipping God through song. A special part of the Weimar
                                           Academy experience would definitively be choir tour. As a whole school we get to travel, share music with various churches,
                                            create long lasting memories, and bond with one another. While we are blessing others, we are ourselves are also blessed 
                                            as we experience God working through us in ways we could never have imagined. The goal of the music program is for music 
                                            to become a natural expression of the students’ love for God employing the whole heart, soul, mind, and strength into musical
                                             worship. 
                                          In this way, music can be a powerful force to reach people who could not have been reached otherwise.

                        Weimar Institute collectively believes that a work education program is an effective way by which the students 
                        can practically learn to labor, to gain essential skills, and to serve both God and their fellow man. 
                        Not only does it induce a sense of teamwork and initiative, but it also encourages them to be leaders.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The work education program has given many academy students the opportunity to gain experience 
                    working in various positions, such as custodial, media, cafeteria, grounds, and as teaching assistants 
                    and resident assistants. These experiences have, in return, opened the doors for every student to serve 
                    their school, their homes, and their communities with an attentive and diligent work ethic.

                    <p>“And the King will answer and say to them, ‘Assuredly, I say to you, inasmuch as you did it to one of 
                        the least of these My brethren, you did it to Me’ ” (Matt. 25:40).
                         These are the very words that Jesus spoke as well as the words by which He so faithfully lived.</p>
                        <div class="about-heal-para">
                            <p>
                                Everything that Jesus did on this earth was for the wellbeing of others. Jesus’ 
                                selflessness was shown when he gave sight to the blind, hearing to the deaf, walk to the lame, 
                                speech to the dumb, freedom from demotic possession, food for the hungry, compassion for the sinners, 
                                and most importantly, when He gave love and forgiveness to all with a broken heart. Jesus came to heal 
                                and serve a hurting people. As followers of Christ, we should strive every day to live as Jesus did. 
                                That is why here at Weimar Academy, we take service so seriously. 
                                Every student is given many opportunities for service, as participation in many 
                                outreach activities is required. 
                            </p>

                                One of these activities is TCI (Total Community Involvement). As a part of this initiative, 
                                the whole school goes out one day every week and connects with those in community instead of 
                                doing regular academic school classes in the morning. The students make new friends by going 
                                door to door, offering their services, and showing them Weimar Institute’s various programs 
                                where many can get help for their physical and spiritual needs. The students also learn to 
                                labor in love for others. Whether by raking a lawn, cleaning out a house, washing a car, baking cookies, 
                                singing, or praying, it is all done for those in the community 
                                who are in need.

                <p>Another opportunity for service is choir tour. Once a year the whole school tours across California with its 
                    orchestra and choir performing sacred Christian music. The goal of this tour is not to bring any glory 
                    or honor to the students, but to give it all to Jesus. Many are greatly moved by the deep words and
                     meanings of the songs, their introductions, and testimonies. 
                </p>
            <div class="about-heal-bottom-paras-last">
                <p>It is a mission trip in itself. Aside from just concerts, the school also 
                    does other work on tour such as handing out literature and helping other 
                    churches and organizations with different events and outreach. It is also 
                    a great opportunity for the students to bond and make lasting friendships 
                    with one another and those whom they serve. One of the biggest events and 
                    highlights of the year is mission trips. Every student has the opportunity 
                    to go out and serve God in another non-local location for two weeks. This gives the students
                     fresh perspectives and sheds light onto living conditions in places 
                     where ordinary necessities are not accessible. </p>
                <p>
                    Just a few trips of the past include Bolivia, Belize, Kenya, Arizona, Philippines,
                     Palou, Cuba, and Dutch Curacao. On these trips the students have been a part of 
                     medical clinics, building projects, concerts, health expos, outreach, evangelistic 
                     meetings, door to door literature distribution, week of prayers, vacation Bible schools,
                      and much more. When a person serves in a place that is out of their comfort zone,
                       it forces them to rely fully on God and His strength. When a person has no other 
                       option but to recognize their own weakness, God’s strength is seen most clearly. 
                       Many miracles are seen every single year on the Academy’s 
                    mission trips when God manifested His power and intervened for His people.

                            Words of kindness, looks of sympathy, expressions of appreciation, would to many a struggling, 
                            lonely one be as a cup of cold water to a thirsty soul. </p>

                      <p>
                        A word of cheer, an act of kindness, would go far to lighten the burdens that are resting heavily 
                        upon weary shoulders. It is in unselfish ministry that true happiness is found. 
                        And every word and deed of such service is recorded in the books of heaven 
                        as done for Christ.”

                    It is such a blessing and great opportunity for the students of Weimar Academy to walk in the 
                    shoes of Jesus in taking care of one another through service. These three aforementioned 
                    service opportunities are not exclusive. 
                   </p>
                    <p>
                            Each student, every day, learns to lay self aside and to honor God through serving his or her fellow man. 
                            It is such an honor that God has called His youth to do the very things that Jesus did on this earth, 
                            and it is Weimar Academy’s honor to raise up a God-loving youth who deny self to bring others to God.

            Weimar Academy is a place where students come not just to learn new things, 
            but to offer what they have learned to the world around them. Sharing what God 
            has done for them is integrated fully into the program. 
           </p>
           <p>
            Through giving worship for the whole student body, music ministry, doing yard work for the community, 
            and actively seeking to help each other, students are encouraged to make Christ-like service a part 
            of their lives. When sharing the Gospel of Jesus through service to others 
             becomes a habit, there is no limit to how God can use their talents all throughout their lives!
